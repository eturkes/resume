            {defended} Master's thesis on the development of new software and
            experimental paradigms for Intellicage, an automated home cage system for
            reproducible animal behavior research. Phenotyping of a novel oxytocin
            receptor knockout model of autism using these paradigms did not reveal
            significant differences from control but suggests directions for future
            paradigms.}
