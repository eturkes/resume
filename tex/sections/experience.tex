    {\begin{cvitems}
        \item{Investigate cell-type vulnerability to pathologic tau using single-cell
            transcriptomics data by building custom pipelines in Rmarkdown. The
            pipelines aim to deeply cluster neuronal cells into subpopulations and then
            identify differentially expressed genes and their enriched pathways.
            \vspace*{0.1cm}}
        \item{Analyze co-immunoprecipitation mass spec data using novel approaches such
            as Watson for Drug Discovery to rank-order proteins and then perform
            pathway analysis.\vspace*{0.1cm}}
        \item{Perform pharmacoepidemiological research to mine data sources for potential
            drug candidates and targets.}
