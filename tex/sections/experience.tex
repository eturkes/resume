            experimental paradigms for Intellicage, an automated home cage system for
            reproducible animal behavior research. Phenotyping of a novel oxytocin
            receptor knockout model of autism did not reveal significant differences
            from control but suggests directions for future paradigms.\vspace*{0.1cm}}
