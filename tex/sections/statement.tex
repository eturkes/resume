\begin{cvparagraph}
    {I am a recent master's graduate currently working in computational neuroscience who is interested in pursuing a PhD in a related field. My bachelor's degree was in neuroscience, which broadly covered a full-spectrum of subfields and research methodologies. Towards the end of my degree, I specialized in computational neuroscience by taking upper-level coursework in that area, volunteering and then working in a neuroimaging lab, and becoming a TA for an intro to computational neuroscience course. After graduating, I moved to Tokyo to complete a master's course, taking additional coursework and writing a thesis focusing on the development of software for novel mouse behavior analysis. Returning to the US, I began a technician position at Columbia University, where I am using multiple data-driven approaches to explore the pathology of Alzheimer's disease and related tauopathies, as well as help develop therapeutic candidates.}
